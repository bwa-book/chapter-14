# Chapter 14 - Using Hardware APIs

Since iPhone SDK was first made available to developers, in 2008, one of the most exciting aspects of developing for Apple platforms has been access to the varied capabilities of the hardware itself. Apple Watch and watchOS are no different, allowing developers access to the potential of the heart rate sensor, the accelerometer, and the much-vaunted haptic feedback system dubbed the Taptic Engine.


## Projects

This repository contains four projects:

1. *Heartbeat* - This project contains an app to demonstrate how to access heartrate data via the HealthKit APIs.
2. *Swoosh* - This project is an example of how to access accelerometer data from the device using CoreMotion.
3. *Mercury* - This project is a further demonstration of using CoreMotion to access the accelerometer, specifically for step measurements.
4. *PlayHaptic* - This project contains a small app intended to illustrate the playback of haptic feedback.
